Right now, it is only looking for keys starting with 'Target wt.%', 'Actual wt.%', or 'at.%' versions and take these as the chemical composition. Hereby, an entry `'base'` is expanded by `(100 - sum(all_other_elements_listes))` if `expand_c_base=True` (default). Also, if `only_actual_c=False` the target composition is used like the actual composition! The temperature is taken from sample rolling or annealing (keys `'Reduction temp[°C]'`, or `(\"Annealing\", 'Temp.[°C]')`). Thus, this data might have significant problems!"
